# Star-Wars-Survey

In this project, I'll be cleaning and exploring the data set in Jupyter notebook. 

While waiting for ["Star Wars: The Force Awakens"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens) to come out, the team at ["FiveThirtyEight"](http://fivethirtyeight.com) became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: *does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?*

The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses. You can download it from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).
